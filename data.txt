commitment Goal-based agent architectures have been one of the most effective
architectures commitment for designing agents.  In such architectures, the state
of the agent as well as its goal set are represented explicitly.  The
agent then uses its set of actions to reach the goals in its goal
set.  However, in multiagent systems, most of the time, an agent
cannot reach a goal only using its own actions but needs other agents' to
act as well.  Commitment has been successfully used to regulate
those interactions between agents.  This paper commitment proposes a framework
and an environment for agents to manage the relations between their
commitments and goals.  Dear sir more specifically, we provide an algorithm called
3245 to 23432 compute if a given set of commitments can be used to achieve a
particular goal.  We describe how ?? can be implemented using the Reactive
Event Calculus and 2342 demonstrate its capabilities over a case study.
